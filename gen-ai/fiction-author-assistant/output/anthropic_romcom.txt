Jamie pushed open the door of Bean There, Done That, the quirky coffee shop's bell announcing his arrival with a cheerful jingle that contrasted sharply with the anxious flutter in his stomach. The place buzzed with early 2000s energy—Norah Jones crooning softly from hidden speakers, the hiss of espresso machines, and the tap-tap-tap of early laptops mixing with animated conversations. He tugged at his carefully chosen button-down shirt, scanning the crowded tables for someone who might be his blind date. NYU's English department hallways hadn't prepared him for this particular literary adventure. A barista with an impressive array of facial piercings caught his eye and winked, as if recognizing the universal look of blind-date terror. Jamie checked his watch—five minutes early—and wondered if Taylor, the law student his roommate had insisted was "perfect for him," would even show up.

A tall figure approached from the corner, coffee in hand, and Jamie's heart sank into his vintage Converse. It was him—Taylor from the disastrous Halloween party last month, where Jamie had enthusiastically performed Britney's "Oops!...I Did It Again" complete with dance moves on a coffee table, only to send a bowl of punch flying directly into Taylor's pristine vampire costume. Recognition dawned simultaneously in Taylor's eyes, his composed law-student demeanor cracking into a surprised "Oh!" before he could catch himself.

"You're the Britney guy," Taylor blurted, then immediately flushed. "I mean—you're Jamie. I didn't realize... when Mark mentioned an English major with 'great dance moves,' I didn't connect the dots."

Jamie wanted to dissolve into the floorboards. "And you're the vampire I baptized in Hawaiian Punch. God, I swear I'm not usually that—" he gestured vaguely, "—catastrophic."

The barista leaned across the counter, her silver nose ring catching the light. "If it helps, that Britney performance was legendary. We've got a regular who still calls this place 'that coffee shop where the dancing guy created the vampire bloodbath.'" She slid two muffins toward them with a conspiratorial smile. "On the house. Consider it my contribution to what's clearly going to be the best meet-cute story at your wedding." Taylor's laugh—rich and unexpected—cut through Jamie's embarrassment. Their eyes met, and something shifted. The tension dissolved into something warmer, more promising. Jamie found himself grinning back, suddenly grateful for his past dancing disaster.

Jamie reached for his coffee, still riding the wave of relief that Taylor wasn't holding a grudge, when his elbow caught the edge of Taylor's law textbook. The cup tipped, sending a cascade of caramel latte across the table. "Oh God, not again!" Jamie groaned, frantically grabbing napkins as coffee dripped onto Taylor's jeans. But instead of annoyance, Taylor burst into laughter—genuine, head-thrown-back laughter that crinkled the corners of his eyes. "At least it's not punch this time," Taylor said, dabbing at his jeans. "And hey, my vampire costume needed the color, but these are just boring old Levi's." Jamie felt his cheeks burn, but found himself laughing too, the shared absurdity of their encounters breaking down walls neither realized they'd built. "I swear I'm normally coordinated," Jamie confessed, "Just not, apparently, when I'm nervous around cute law students." The admission hung between them, unexpectedly honest, and Taylor's smile softened into something warmer, more intimate.

The memory hit Jamie with startling clarity—Taylor in a different setting, equally disastrous. Last summer at Mark's sister's wedding reception, where Jamie had been roped into giving an impromptu toast after the best man disappeared with a bridesmaid. There was Taylor, looking unfairly handsome in a navy suit, watching from across the room as Jamie's champagne-fueled speech veered wildly off-course into an anecdote about the bride's college ferret-smuggling scandal. The horrified silence had been broken only by Taylor's unexpected snort of laughter, a sound that had saved Jamie from complete social death. Later, by the chocolate fountain, Taylor had approached with two flutes of champagne. "Best wedding toast I've ever heard," he'd said, eyes dancing with amusement. They'd talked for twenty minutes before Jamie accidentally backed into the fountain, soaking the back of his rented tux in liquid chocolate. Taylor had gallantly offered his jacket, their fingers brushing during the exchange—a moment of electricity neither had acknowledged until now, sitting across from each other in this coffee shop, recognition dawning in their eyes.

Taylor leaned forward, a mischievous glint replacing the recognition in his eyes. "I think we need to address the elephant in the room," he said, reaching into his messenger bag. Jamie braced himself for awkwardness, but instead, Taylor pulled out a small deck of cards. "Truth or Dare: Coffee Shop Edition. I made it for a law school party that never happened." He shuffled the cards with surprising dexterity. "Every time one of us spills something or creates a minor disaster—which, let's be honest, seems inevitable—the other gets to draw a card." Jamie's mouth fell open, caught between disbelief and delight. This perfectly put-together law student had a playful side that no one at the Halloween party or wedding would have suspected. "You actually made disaster-themed cards?" Jamie asked, already reaching for the deck. Taylor's smile was both shy and challenging. "I figured we might need an icebreaker. Though with our track record, we're more likely to need a mop."

Around them, Bean There, Done That pulsed with its own peculiar heartbeat. A gray-haired woman in a vibrant orange scarf—a regular known only as "Professor Poetry"—peered over vintage cat-eye glasses, her notebook temporarily abandoned as she tilted her head toward their table. Two tables over, the self-proclaimed "WiFi Warriors"—a trio of web designers who'd claimed the corner booth as their unofficial office since the dial-up days—exchanged knowing glances, their fingers pausing over keyboards. The barista with the nose ring made no pretense of not listening, wiping the same spot on the counter for the third time while nodding approvingly at Taylor's cards. Even Headphones Guy, perpetually plugged into his Discman, had one earphone dangling free, his head bobbing to a rhythm that had nothing to do with whatever indie rock was playing through his remaining earpiece. The coffee shop had transformed into an impromptu theater, and Jamie and Taylor had unwittingly become the main attraction—a romantic comedy unfolding in real time amid the steam of espresso machines and the warm glow of early 2000s optimism.

Jamie drew a card, his fingers brushing Taylor's as he pulled it from the deck. "Truth: What's your guilty pleasure?" He read aloud, then looked up with a grin. "Mine's easy—I'm obsessed with karaoke bars. Not the trendy ones, but those hole-in-the-wall places in Chinatown where no one speaks English and the song selections stopped updating in 1997."

Taylor's eyes widened, coffee cup frozen halfway to his lips. "You're kidding. I have a spreadsheet ranking every karaoke spot in the five boroughs." He pulled out his Palm Pilot, tapping excitedly at the screen. "Golden Dragon on Mott Street? Their sound system is terrible but they have the best selection of power ballads."

"And those private rooms with the disco lights!" Jamie exclaimed, leaning forward. "I thought I was the only law-abiding citizen who spent Thursday nights belting 'Total Eclipse of the Heart' to a room of strangers!"

They stared at each other, momentarily speechless, the coffee shop fading around them as an unexpected bridge materialized between their worlds.

The barista interrupted their moment of connection, sliding two fresh coffees onto the table. "One caramel latte and one black Americano," she announced with a wink. Jamie reached for what he thought was his latte, taking a generous sip before his face contorted in surprise. Taylor simultaneously grimaced at his first taste.

"I think we've got each other's drinks," Jamie laughed, the bitter taste of Taylor's Americano lingering on his tongue.

"Well," Taylor said, a slow smile spreading across his face as he held up Jamie's sweet concoction, "I guess this means we'll have to meet again to sort out our coffee preferences." He pulled out a business card, scribbling something on the back. "Golden Dragon, Thursday night? I've got a private room reserved at eight."

Jamie took the card, their fingers touching longer than necessary. "It's a date," he replied, already wondering what song they might sing together.
