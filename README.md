# About me

I'm an AI engineer with 13+ years of professional software development experience, with about half of that time at AI startups. I've contributed to many different systems: CRUD web applications, data pipelines, machine learning platforms, cloud-based chatbots, LLM-driven applications, etc.

My strongest and favorite programming language is Python. I've also written a lot of software in Javascript, Bash, Ruby, and some using C/C++, Lua, and Go.

My last major role was at a jobs and recruiting-focused AI startup where I spent 4+ years working on conversational AI. I contributed significant code to the backend systems, ML model experimentation, inference, and maintenance, and LLM experimentation and integration.

# About this portfolio

For this portfolio, my intention is to provide work samples that demonstrate my experience with various components of AI systems I've built throughout my career. It showcases my experience with Python web applications, system design, traditional ML, and generative AI. Please get in touch if you have any question or if you'd like to explore working together!
